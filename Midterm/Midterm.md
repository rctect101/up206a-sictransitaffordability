## Sic Transit Affordability

Fernando Abarca & Ryan Caro

### Introduction
Our research question intends to explore the relationship between transportation and housing affordability. We will use several data sets to analyze potential correlations between use of transportation mode and housing. By analysing data from 2010 to 2018 we can infer if public transit expansion is correlated with increased transit use, rent costs, and housing construction in Los Angeles County, particularly near the recently expanded Expo and Gold Lines. 

### Why It Matters
The information we retrieve by comparing these data sets will allow us to see the impact that public transportation expansion and investment may have in incentivizing new construction and, furthermore, on rent levels in LA County. This research is important to us because we have seen different city officials, agencies, and advocacy groups advocating for the expansion of Metro Rail and alternative forms of mobility. However this has sparked debate on whether metro rail investment and expansion has led to rent level increases and new construction development, particularly in low income neighborhoods. Unfortunately, these new developments may be leading to further displacement and gentrification in underserved communities. Visualizing the relationship between these three factors and determining whether they have led to rent increases is important for advocacy efforts in favor of prioritizing affordable housing development near transit. COVID has further exacerbated the houseless problem in Los Angeles. Development of affordable housing in general, but especially near transit, is one strategy in ensuring at risk families maintain a roof over their head while having access to affordable transportation. 

###Spatial Scope
The spatial scope for this project is LA County, particularly the census tracts around the Expo and Gold Lines, while the temporal scope is from 2010 to 2018. We have changed our data sources from ones which are exclusive to the City of Los Angeles to ones that our county-wide by using American Community Survey data from Social Explorer. The Social Explorer data is also more recent, coming through 2018, so we can look at the 2016 extensions of the Expo and Gold Lines.

### Data Sources
We have moved from Neighborhood Data for Social Change to ACS data because it covers all of LA County rather than just the City of LA and is current through 2018 rather than 2016.
* Housing Units from 2010 and 2018 American Community Surveys at [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/). We originally were going to use construction permits, but using total number of housing units also controls for demolition of housing.
* Median Gross Rent from 2010 and 2018 American Community Surveys at [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/). Though this does not control home size or housing quality, it shows where median rents have changed or held constant in Los Angeles. It also has the benefit of converting all data to 2018 dollars to control for inflation. 
* Means of Transportation to Work for Workers 16 Years and Over from 2010 and 2018 American Community Surveys at [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/)
* LA Metro rail lines from [LA Metro Developer Data](https://developer.metro.net/docs/gis-data/overview/). We can overlay our maps with the LA Metro lines to show which areas are closest to rail lines. 
* LA County census tracts from the [LA Times](http://boundaries.latimes.com/sets/).

### Scope
We intend to use these datasets to analyze how median rents have changed along with both housing units and transit use from 2010 to 2018. While we cannot show a causal relationship, we expect to observe many interesting correlations between these data. Since the data is organized by census tracts, we will be able to use choropleths to show which neighborhoods have the highest levels of median rent, transit use, and new construction. If possible, we would like to create a sliding time scale to switch between years to show how the data we are analyzing has changed over time. We will overlay our maps with the LA Metro rail lines to show which areas are closest to Metro rail stations, as mentioned above. 

### Conclusion
Through this project, we hope to better understand the interaction of transit use, construction, and housing affordability. Since both the Expo Line and Gold Line were expanded in 2016, we are particularly interested in how the new rail line affected these three factors. We will be able to identify neighborhoods that have remained affordable, whether despite or because of new construction.
