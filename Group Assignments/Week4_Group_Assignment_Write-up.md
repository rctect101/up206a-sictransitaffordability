# Sic Transit Affordability
Fernando Abarca & Ryan Caro

### Roles

Fernando Abarca
* Title: SicCharts
* Role: For our midterm, Fernando will support the initial writing for our project. He will write out the research question and why this question matters. He will also support the write-up for the final data analysis (Lead Writer). For the visual component, Fernando will also focus on creating charts to depict our data visually and provide input on visual design of both maps and charts for midterm projects.   

Ryan Caro
* Title: Dance Captain
* Roles: Ryan has some project management experience so he will focus on structuring the different elements of the project. He has also done some work with Python before so he will help with researching any coding elements that arenâ€™t directly covered in class

### Status Update
The general mood of the team is excited. We are both excited about the different tools and skills we are learning in our weekly classes. We have been eager to produce maps, charts, and graphs for our project. At times we have produced similar work and incorporated different data sources that have not necessarily fit our project. But it has allowed both of us to go through the motions of replicating the steps we have gone over from the previous class. Dividing the work and working on the project remotely has been a bit challenging. There is no way to both work and edit the same notebook file in Jupyterhub in the same way we can edit and work on a shared Google document. Being able to do this would make things logistically easier. But our communication has been good, which has made coordinating, delegating, and managing work easier to handle. 

### Data Update
We have decided to use American Community Survey Data from [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/explore-maps) rather than the data from [Neighborhood Data for Social Change](https://usc.data.socrata.com/Los-Angeles/Commute-Mode-LA-/ff5n-m9wp) as originally planned. The ACS data covers a larger date range and all of Los Angeles County, whereas NDSC only covers the City of Los Angeles. This will allow us to look more closely at the Expo Line, which was extended into Culver City and Santa Monica in 2012 and 2016 respectively. 

### Concerns
A minor concern we have is narrowing in on the story we want to present. We have enough data to tell many different stories, especially since we are comparing three different variables (commute mode, median rent, and housing starts). It is more about us deciding the best approach to tell and show a proper story of transit and affordability. 

Another minor concern is coordination over time and space. Having multiple people work on the same Jupyter notebook is difficult, so we look forward to seeing if there are other ways to divide the work.
